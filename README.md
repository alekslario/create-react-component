# CREATE-REACT-COMPONENT

### Generates directory for React component.

Forked from https://github.com/olehvolynets/create-react-component and edited to fill my needs.


Filled with starter template, has options for **Pure** and **Functional** components

In the end you get a directory that looks like this:

```
-ComponentFolder/
---Component.js
---styled.js
---index.js
```
